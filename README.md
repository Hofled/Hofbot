# Hofbot
A twitch.tv chat bot.

Hofbot is written in Typescript and uses tmi.js API to integrate with the twitch.tv chat.

The bot has been designed with the thought in mind of it being hosted on a Raspberry pi, altough it can run over any computer and function the same way.

The bot is still in the making and is in its early-versions.

Any suggestions for improvement are welcome, please feel free to open new issues.
